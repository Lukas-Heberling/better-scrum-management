> This tool is designed to plan and manage requirements within a sprint.


## Project Goals

- In the company where I currently work we use Scrum in our projects. But since our ticket system is not designed for Scrum I want to write this tool to extend it with Scrum.
- However, the tool is not only intended to extend a ticket system. I want to implement it in such a way that the tool can also be used without another ticket system.
- I have not worked with Nextjs before, but since you only   hear good things about it I want to give it a try.
