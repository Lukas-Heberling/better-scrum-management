# Better Scrum Frontend

> The frontend is written using Nextjs.

So far I haven't decided if I want to use a library like Tailwind,
but I would like to do as much as possible without external libraries :smile:

## Pages

`[host path]/`
- Login

`[host path]/better-scrum`
- The main page for the project
  - It will be possible to handle diffrent departments
  - Projects in each department
  - A Product Backlog for each Project
  - And Sprints


## Later

> Things i want to add later during the project

- Dashboards for a Project and each Sprint
- Pages to create Protocols of all the meetings
- A page where it is easy to plan a sprint and compare with the last sprints
